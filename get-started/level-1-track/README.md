## The Value
**Time saved:** Hours per week/month
**Cost reduction:** £ amount
**Revenue impact:** If applicable
**Other benefits:** Quality, speed, compliance

## The Risks
**Technical:** Can we build it?
**Data:** Do we have the data?
**Adoption:** Will people use it?
**Compliance:** Any regulatory concerns?

## Next Step
**Action:** What's the single next action?

### 3. Prioritisation Matrix

Score your initiatives to decide what to focus on.

| Initiative | Value (1-5) | Effort (1-5) | Risk (1-5) | Score | Priority |
|------------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------|----------|
| Example: Customer chatbot | 4 | 2 | 2 | 8 | High |
| Example: Fraud detection | 5 | 5 | 4 | 6 | Medium |

**Scoring:**
- **Value:** Business impact (5 = transformational)
- **Effort:** Implementation difficulty (5 = very hard)
- **Risk:** What could go wrong (5 = very risky)
- **Score:** Value - (Effort + Risk)/2

## Quick Start: Google Sheets

1. Open [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com)
2. Create a new spreadsheet
3. Add these columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ID | Unique identifier (AI-001, AI-002...) |
| Name | Initiative name |
| Owner | Who's responsible |
| Stage | Idea / Discovery / Alpha / Beta / Live |
| Department | Business unit |
| Value Score | 1-5 |
| Effort Score | 1-5 |
| Risk Level | Minimal / Limited / High |
| Status | On Track / At Risk / Blocked |
| Last Updated | Date |
| Notes | Free text |

4. Add your current initiatives
5. Share with your team

**Time:** 15 minutes

---

## What to Track First

Start with what you already have:

### Discovery Questions

1. **What AI tools are people already using?**
   - ChatGPT? Copilot? Others?
   - Even informal/personal use counts

2. **What AI pilots are running?**
   - Proof of concepts
   - Experiments
   - "Someone's side project"

3. **What AI is in production?**
   - Chatbots
   - Automations
   - Recommendations
   - Analytics

4. **What AI ideas are floating around?**
   - Things people have suggested
   - Vendor pitches
   - Competitor observations

**Most organisations discover they have 3-5x more AI activity than they thought.**

## Example Portfolio

Here's what a starter portfolio might look like:

| ID | Name | Stage | Dept | Value | Effort | Risk |
|----|------|-------|------|-------|--------|------|
| AI-001 | Customer Service Chatbot | Beta | Support | 4 | 3 | Limited |
| AI-002 | Document Classification | Alpha | Legal | 3 | 2 | Minimal |
| AI-003 | Fraud Detection | Discovery | Finance | 5 | 5 | High |
| AI-004 | Staff using ChatGPT | Live | Various | 3 | 1 | Limited |
| AI-005 | Predictive Maintenance | Idea | Operations | 4 | 4 | Limited |

## Next Steps

Once you've captured your initiatives:

**Option A: Keep it simple**
- Continue using spreadsheets
- Review monthly with your team
- Update as things change

**Option B: Level up**
- → [Level 2: Visualise](../level-2-visualize) — Deploy the visual dashboard

---

## Common Questions

**Q: How detailed should each entry be?**
A: Start simple. Name, owner, stage, value score. Add detail later.

**Q: What if we have 50+ initiatives?**
A: Great problem! Focus on the top 10-15 by value score first.

**Q: Who should maintain this?**
A: Ideally one person owns the portfolio view, but each initiative has its own owner.

**Q: How often to update?**
A: Monthly minimum. Weekly if things are moving fast.
