## What You'll Learn

Most organisations manage AI wrong. They treat it like a traditional project:
- Fixed scope, fixed timeline, "done" when deployed

But AI is fundamentally different:
- Models drift over time
- Data quality degrades
- Regulations change
- User needs evolve

**AI initiatives are never "done." They're operational capabilities that need continuous attention.**

This level helps you understand *why* that matters and *what* to do about it.

## The Core Insight

### Traditional Project Thinking

```
Idea → Requirements → Build → Test → Deploy → DONE ✓
```

Works for: Websites, apps, systems with fixed requirements

### AI Portfolio Thinking

```
Idea → Experiment → Learn → Deploy → Monitor → Learn → Improve → Monitor...
         ↑                                                    │
         └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The loop never ends. And that's not a bug—it's the nature of AI.

## Why 95% of AI Projects Fail

Research from MIT (2025) found that 95% of AI pilots fail to deliver business value.

**The main reasons:**

| Failure Mode | What Happens | Portfolio Fix |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| No business case | "We did AI!" but no value | Prioritisation matrix |
| No monitoring | Model degrades, nobody notices | Operational dashboard |
| No iteration | First version deployed, never improved | Experiment tracking |
| No governance | Compliance issues emerge late | Risk classification |

**Strata helps you avoid all four.**

## The Three Layers

Successful AI implementation has three layers (hence "Strata"):

### Layer 1: Infrastructure (Build First)
- Reliable, secure, cost-effective foundation
- Where your AI actually runs
- **Why first:** Without this, nothing else works reliably

### Layer 2: Intelligence (Build Second)
- The learning, memory, and decision logic
- Where your AI gets smarter
- **Why second:** Needs infrastructure to run

### Layer 3: Experience (Build Last)
- What users see and interact with
- Chatbots, dashboards, automations
- **Why last:** Needs intelligence to be useful

**Most failures happen because teams start at Layer 3** (the shiny demo) without building Layers 1 and 2.

## Key Concepts

### AI Portfolio
A collection of AI initiatives at different stages (ideas, experiments, production) managed as a whole.

### Initiative Lifecycle
```
💡 Idea → 🔬 Discovery → 🧪 Alpha → 📊 Beta → 🚀 Live → 📈 Optimise
```

### Risk Classification (EU AI Act)
- **Unacceptable:** Banned (social scoring, etc.)
- **High-Risk:** Requires documentation, human oversight
- **Limited Risk:** Transparency requirements
- **Minimal Risk:** No special requirements

### The Verification Tax
AI outputs need human verification. The cost of that verification is often higher than expected—and rises when you fire the humans who understand the domain.

## Quick Self-Assessment

Answer these questions about your organisation:

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| How many AI initiatives do you have? | ___ |
| How many are in production? | ___ |
| How many are monitored regularly? | ___ |
| Who owns each initiative? | ___ |
| What's the ROI of each? | ___ |

**If you struggled to answer any of these, you need a portfolio view.**
